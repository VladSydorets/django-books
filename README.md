# Implementation Note

I focused primarily on implementing the waitlist and double opt-in email confirmation flow using Django’s email framework, as other features looked too big to complete in 2 hours and would have been too incomplete. The UI was kept minimal for the most part (mobile responsiveness was not addressed at all), in order to prioritize the completeness of the backend email and confirmation logic.
